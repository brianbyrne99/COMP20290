# algorithm-portfolio-20290-brianbyrne99
This repo feautures the Java segments of my weekly practicals for COMP20290- "Algorithms". Each class is tested in the main for 
functionality and for how well it preforms. I measured its preformance based on each methods running time, which i measured in nanoseconds.

## Fibonacci
Java implementation of both recursive and iterative algorithms that calculate the Fibonacci number up to an entered integer.

## Hanoi
A recursive Java method which prints instructions on how to successfully move disks in the game "Towers of Hanoi".
the method takes an int input for the number of disks you are playing with.

## KMPsearch
Java implementation of the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm, which searches for substrings in a larger string.

## RussianPeasents
Java imlementaiton of the old Russian method of multiplying lage numbers.

## Sorts
A class where selection sort, merge sort, enhanced merge sort, Stalin sort, quick sort and insertion sort are all implemented.

## Stringsearches
Brute force algorithm to search a string for a given subtstring.

## Trie
A tree data structure implementation that strings cna be entered into and subsequently searched for.
